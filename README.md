## Projects
### Educational Titles Registered in Ecuador  
**Power BI Dashboard**: [View Dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNTQxYTk2ZTktYWEzZS00OWI3LTg3YzAtZjJmZjBkZDc1YmJiIiwidCI6ImI3YWY4Y2FmLTgzZDgtNDY0NC04NWFlLTMxN2M1NDUyMjNjMSIsImMiOjR9)  
This interactive **Power BI** dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of the educational titles registered in Ecuador, sourced from **SENESCYT** (Secretaría Nacional de Educación Superior, Ciencia y Tecnología) and **SNIESE** (Sistema Nacional de Información de Educación Superior del Ecuador). 

#### Key features of the dashboard:
- **Distribution of Titles**: Visualizes the proportion of titles across different educational levels (e.g., ‘Técnico’, ‘Tercer Nivel’).
- **Trends Over Time**: Displays how the issuance of titles has evolved over the years, offering valuable insights into the progression of higher education.
- **Regional Analysis**: Breaks down the data by province, highlighting regional educational achievements and disparities.
  
This project is aimed at assisting educational authorities, policy makers, and researchers to better understand the current educational landscape and make data-driven decisions. By automating the data updates and visualizations, it ensures real-time insights and helps identify trends that may affect policy or educational funding.
